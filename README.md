# AvantCustom (plugin for Omeka Classic)

The AvantCustom plugin provides a way for an administrator/developer to add custom logic to their Omeka installation
without having to create a plugin from scratch. A plugin can provide new functionality, or modify existing functionality,
in ways that are not possible by modifying a theme.

**This plugin is intended for use by developers who are familiar with Omeka plugins and understand how filters and hooks
are used to add or modify Omeka features.**


## Dependencies
The AvantCustom plugin requires that the [AvantCommon](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantCommon) plugin be installed and activated.

## Installation

To install the AvantCustom plugin, follow these steps:

1. First install and activate the [AvantCommon](https://github.com/gsoules/AvantCommon) plugin.
1. Unzip the AvantCustom-master file into your Omeka installation's plugin directory.
1. Rename the folder to AvantCustom.
1. Activate the plugin from the Admin → Settings → Plugins page.
