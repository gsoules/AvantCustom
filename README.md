# AvantCustom (plugin for Omeka Classic)

The AvantCustom plugin customizes Omeka's admin and public interfaces. It provides:

* Eliminates Item Type dropdown list in favor of a single admin-chosen Item Type which is used for all items.
* Hides 'Collection' in the admin left menu panel.
* Customizations to the Omeka admin interface e.g. showing colored lines based on item type.
* Custom fallback images based on type.
* Researcher access to non-public items using the public interface
* Down-for-maintenance feature

 > At this time, the AvantCustom implementation is specific to the Southwest Harbor Public Library's [Digital Archive](http://swhplibrary.net/archive) and therefore **this plugin is not yet usable as-is for another Omeka installation**. However, the source code is provided here for the benefit of software developers who want to learn about the logic or adapt it for use on another project.
 
This plugin was developed for the [Southwest Harbor Public Library](http://www.swhplibrary.org/), in Southwest Harbor, Maine. Funding was provided in part by the [John S. and James L. Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/).
